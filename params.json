{"name":"Expandyourcircle","tagline":"Environmental Education","body":"## What is \"Expand Your Circle\"?.\r\nThis educational app will allow users to connect with and learn about animals in northern Illinois. This app can teach people about different animals in northern Illinois. It will allow users to search for specific animals, scroll through a list of animals in the area, add favorites, and upload their own photos. The favorites option will allow users to tap a button to add animals to their favorites list and then view them on a separate page. The option to upload photos will allow users to add their own pictures that they took of the animal they saw. The app will be specifically for animals of northern Illinois, but over time I plan to update it with species from other parts of Illinois and the country.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
